### Work

For this learning experience, you will do two things:

1. **Read/watch/respond**. *For each module*, you will engage with the resources presented (watch videos/read documents), and then reflect on each topic, using this prompt: *What key concept(s) in each topic do you consider to be more relevant to your students/important for them to learn, and why?* These reflections are asking about you take on the big ideas for each area, and to think about them and how they would affect your students. For each, I expect 200-250 words. You can do this work in Office 365/Word or Google Docs. If you do use Office 365/Word, please share your work with me via gerald.ardito@mville.edu. If you use Google Docs,  please share your work with me via arditog@mville.edu. In either case, please be sure to give me editing privileges.
2. **Create a Presentation/Write a Paper**. *For a culminating activity*, you will either: a) ***create a presentation*** that demonstrates how you would engage your elementary students in each of the topics addressed **or** b) ***write a paper*** that describes how you would engage your elementary students in each of the topics addressed. In either format (presentation or paper), you will be discussing how you would engage elementary students in each of the topics included in this learning experience (*Fundamentals of Health & Wellness, Personal and School Safety, Drugs, Fire Safety and Arson*, and *Physical Fitness/Nutrition*). What I expect is that for each topic you would identify the big ideas for each area, and then describe the ways you think best to address them with your students.
